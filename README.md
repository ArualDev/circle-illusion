# Circle Illusion

This is a small p5.js sketch that showcases a visual illusion, creating an interesting effect where points moving in straight lines appear to form a rotating circle. I created it after getting inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNe6fsaCVtI) by *brusspup*, although I don't know where the illusion originally appeared first. I expanded on the idea and added some intractability that lets you play around with some parameters creating even more cool effects.
